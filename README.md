A minimalist boilerplate for starting React Native apps with Webpack and ES6/7 using Babel. Leverages [`react-native-webpack-server`](https://github.com/mjohnston/react-native-webpack-server). Incorporates sane linting rules for React Native with ESLint. Follows the latest React Native stable release.

For an example implementation check out [Lumpen Radio](https://github.com/jhabdas/lumpen-radio). Or check out some other [Awesome React Boilerplates](http://habd.as/awesome-react-boilerplates/#react-native).

## Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org) 4.x or better
- [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for development
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for iOS development (optional)
- [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/) for Android development (optional)
- [Android Lollipop](https://www.android.com/versions/lollipop-5-0/) or better for Android device testing (optional)

## Stack

- [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for native app development
- [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for ES6+ support
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) module loader and bundler

## Installation

Start by cloning this repo and installing dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jhabdas/react-native-webpack-starter-kit.git
cd react-native-webpack-starter-kit
npm install
npm un -D react-native-webpack-server && npm i -D react-native-webpack-server
```

## Running

Once dependencies are installed, start the application with:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start a [Webpack Dev Server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) which will watch your JS files for changes and automatically generate the `index.[platform].js` file expected by your React Native iOS or Android app.

### iOS

Open `ios/App.xcodeproj` in Xcode, build and run the project.

Unlike the app currently generated by `react-native init` this app removes the `UIViewControllerBasedStatusBarAppearance` key to prevent the app from logging an error in Xcode and leading to an App Store rejection. The key may be added back, if desired, but its value must be set to `true` to prevent unexpected rejection during the review process.

### Android

For android development use the following:

```sh
npm run android-setup-port
react-native run-android
```

Note Android support in React Native is relatively new, so expect some hiccups. Please see the official [Android Setup](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/android-setup.html#content) documentation for getting set-up and the [`README` in RNWS](https://github.com/mjohnston/react-native-webpack-server/blob/27218e70f655983aff99a8a31d258eda5254aaf6/README.md) for additional information. And here's some [helpful npm scripts](https://github.com/mjohnston/react-native-webpack-server/issues/65#issuecomment-151222398) courtesy of [@niftylettuce](https://github.com/niftylettuce).

If you run into any issues please see the [Getting Started](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) guide for React Native before submitting an issue.

## Testing

As a minimalist seed this project does not introduce a testing framework. Instead it leverages simple static code analysis to help prevent coding mistakes and introduce some good practices for building React Native apps with ES6.

Webpack is configured with a pre-loader to lint the application with ESLint using the Babel parser during app development. And the `npm test` command may be run at anytime to lint source code otherwise. See the `.eslintrc` file to adjust [linter rules](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/) to your liking.

## Bundling

Building the app for distribution.

1. Execute `npm run bundle` to generate the [offline JS bundle](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device-ios.html#using-offline-bundle).
2. For iOS, update `AppDelegate.m` to load from pre-bundled file on disk.
3. Test the application, create an archive and submit to the store.

## Submitting to App Store

Please see [Submitting to App Store](http://habd.as/reflecting-on-react-native-development/#submitting-to-app-store). If you'd like help getting your app in the store I'm [available for booking](https://www.codementor.io/jhabdas) on Codementor.
